# Muslim-Islam-Discord-Bot

An Islamic Discord bot for any muslim that uses Discord! The bot will do it's best to make sure you are a proper muslim while spending your time on Discord. It will help you meet other muslims and learn about Islam on a daily basis. It is just a small bot for now but will be growing with more and more features over time. Inshallah we will make something amazing together.

## Getting Your Own Bot

1. Clone the repo.
2. Create a bot user on Discord.
3. Create a `.env` file like the `.env.example` file provided and add all necessary information including your bot token.
4. Run the command `npm run dev`. To see all available command scripts please check the scripts in `package.json`.
5. Open Discord to where you have added your bot and type `!ping`.
6. Enjoy!

If it does not work please contact us at the discord link above to get support or make an issue.

## Inviting The Bot To Your Server

At this time, I will not be showing you how to add the bot because I do not feel it is ready or completed to a point where it should be added to a server. It is still very much in development and should be treated as such. Feel free to test the bot out on the discord server above. In the meantime, if you already know how to invite bots it is a public bot and you can invite it but once again I would highly recommend against it.
